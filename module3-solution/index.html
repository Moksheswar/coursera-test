        <h5>Chicken</h5>
        <p>
          The chicken is a domesticated junglefowl species, 
          with attributes of wild species such as the grey 
          and the Ceylon junglefowl that are originally from Southeast Asia.
          Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds,
          and a younger male may be called a cockerel. 
          A male that has been castrated is a capon. 
          An adult female bird is called a hen, and a 
          sexually immature female is called a pullet. 
          Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of 
          food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as 
          pets. Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting, 
          which is still practiced in some places.
