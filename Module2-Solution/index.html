        <h3 id="b1">Chicken</h3>
        <p>
            The chicken is a domesticated junglefowl species, 
            with attributes of wild species such as the grey 
            and the Ceylon junglefowl that are originally from Southeast Asia.
            Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds,
            and a younger male may be called a cockerel. 
            A male that has been castrated is a capon. 
            An adult female bird is called a hen, and a 
            sexually immature female is called a pullet. 
            Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of 
            food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as 
            pets. Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting, 
            which is still practiced in some places.

        <h3 id="b2">Beef</h3>
        <p>
            Beef can be prepared in various ways; 
            cuts are often used for steak, 
            which can be cooked to varying degrees of doneness, 
            while trimmings are often ground or minced, 
            as found in most hamburgers. Beef contains protein, iron, and vitamin B12. 
            Along with other kinds of red meat, high consumption is associated with an 
            increased risk of colorectal cancer and coronary heart disease, especially 
            when processed. Beef has a high environmental impact, being a primary driver 
            of deforestation with the highest greenhouse gas emissions of any agricultural product.

        <h3 id="b3">Sushi</h3>
        <p>
            sushi, a staple rice dish of Japanese cuisine, consisting of 
            cooked rice flavoured with vinegar and a variety of vegetable, 
            egg, or raw seafood garnishes and served cold. Restaurants 
            specializing in sushi abound in Japan, where subtleties of 
            preparation find a discriminating clientele, and the dish 
            has gained popularity in the United States and elsewhere.
            Nigiri-zushi is a hand-formed oblong of rice topped with 
            sliced raw seafood and a dab of wasabi (a green paste made 
            of true wasabi or horseradish); the ingredients of oshi-zushi 
            are pressed to shape in a mold.
